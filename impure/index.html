                            <p>My name is Adam Day. I grew up in Lawrenceville, Georgia and graduated
                                from Dacula High School.
                                Growing
                                up, I was on the swim team and played multiple wind instruments. I also really enjoyed
                                video
                                games,
                                and
                                I always wished I had the knowledge to make one, but I never had the resources to learn.

                    <div class="rowo">

                        <p>I went to the University of Georgia for my undergraduate degree in
                            Environmental Engineering.
                            Go
                            Dawgs! I
                            love watching UGA football, and I was in the redcoats. I wanted to use my analytical
                            abilities
                            to
                            help
                            the world, so I majored in engineering.

                        <p>For the past few years, I've been working as a civil engineer. I also have an
                            incredible
                            German
                            Shephard named Louise! Unfortunately, I have found civil engineering unfulfilling. I
                            want to
                            have a
                            merit-based career outside of the government. So I have decided to pursue software
                            development!
                            I
                            think it will
                            be a much better fit for me in the long run and I'm very excited to have the courage
                            to
                            chase my
                            life-long dream.
